FriendRate
====

An Android app which pulls your Facebook friends and randomly selects two friends, lets the user select 
"Who's more fun", and then shows the next two friends. After 10 selections, it displays a rank of the results.

You can also swipe to skip a particular choice you don't wanna make :).
